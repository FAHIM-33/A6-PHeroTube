    <h1>Scope of var let and const:</h1>
    <p>All of these let's us make variables but has different stats. variables make with 'var' becomes global meaning it becomes accessible from anywhere from the program. It is called "Hoisting" and it is a problem and it is also re-declarable. <br><br> 'let' is not re-declarable but we can update the value. It does not create hoisting.<br><br> 'const' variables cannot be updated and cannot be re-declared. it remains constant. and does not create hoisting.</p>

    <h1>Use cases of null and undefined:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Undefined: It means, a varible has been declared by a name but the value has not been assigned yet. We can use it to detect empty variables. It is a falsy value.</li>
        <li>
            Null: It means, there is no variable in that name. The variable has not been declared nor assigned. If we try to use a variable that does not exist, it will return 'null'. The value is also falsy. So, we can use it to identify falsy value.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>What id REST API:</h1>

It lets us access the web services easily. It allows systems written with different languages to interact with each other.
